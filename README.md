# verifyhash

A tamper-evident, permissionless, immutable on-chain registry of code-contribution hashes
(Polygon-targeted). Anchor the hash of a file or an entire repository on-chain; anyone can later
prove that some content is byte-for-byte what was anchored — without trusting any server, any
admin, or any private key to read.

The registry contract (`contracts/ContributionRegistry.sol`) is deliberately ownerless: no admin,
no pause, no upgrade path, and it never holds funds. Each content hash can be anchored exactly once
(first-writer-wins) and can never be altered or deleted. That immutability is the product.

## What it proves (and what it does NOT)

> **Read this before relying on a record:** [`docs/TRUST-BOUNDARIES.md`](docs/TRUST-BOUNDARIES.md)

A record attests to **one** thing: the exact 32-byte `contentHash` you queried was anchored
on-chain, by some address, in some block, and has not changed since. The other fields are weaker
than they look:

- **`uri` is an untrusted hint.** The contract never fetches, validates, or hashes it. To trust a
  record you must independently fetch the content, **re-derive its hash** (`vh hash`), and check that
  the recomputed hash equals the anchored `contentHash`. The `uri` proves nothing on its own.
- **`timestamp` / `blockNumber` prove on-chain ordering and an upper bound on existence time**
  ("this content existed no later than this block") — **not** authorship time and not who authored
  it. `block.timestamp` is set by the block proposer (validator-influenced), so it is not a precise
  wall clock; prefer `blockNumber` for hard ordering.
- **`contributor` is the first *anchorer*, not a proven author** (attribution is tracked as decision
  D-1 / task T-0.3).

Full detail, including the table of "trust it for / do NOT trust it for", is in
[`docs/TRUST-BOUNDARIES.md`](docs/TRUST-BOUNDARIES.md). The exact directory-root construction is in
[`docs/MERKLE-LEAVES.md`](docs/MERKLE-LEAVES.md).

## CLI (`cli/vh.js`)

```
vh hash   <path>            # keccak256 of a file, or the Merkle root of a directory
vh anchor <path> [--uri u]  # anchor the hash on-chain (testnet only; --dry-run needs no key)
vh verify <path>            # recompute the hash, look it up on-chain, report MATCH / MISMATCH
vh prove  <file> --root dir # generate + on-chain-verify a per-file Merkle proof
```

`vh verify` is read-only: it re-derives the content hash and compares it to what is anchored, which
is exactly the integrity check the trust model requires. It needs only an RPC URL — no key, no
funds.

## Develop

```
npm install
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
```

Local hardhat / in-memory EVM only. Deployment to any real network is a human checkpoint
(see `BACKLOG.md`, EPIC-4); never run automatically.
