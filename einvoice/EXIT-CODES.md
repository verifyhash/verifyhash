# einvoice CLI exit-code contract

This is the machine-readable exit-code and error-taxonomy contract for the
`einvoice` command-line tool (`einvoice validate`, `validate-batch`, `receipt`;
also reachable as `python3 -m einvoice ...`). The codes below are a **versioned
contract**: a caller (CI gate, Makefile, shell script) can branch on the
process return code and rely on its meaning across releases.

The values here were **measured against the live CLI at HEAD**, not assumed. The
symbolic constants live in `einvoice/cli.py` (`EXIT_OK=0`, `EXIT_FAIL=1`,
`EXIT_USAGE=2`, `EXIT_PARSE=3`); the batch precedence lives in
`einvoice.report.batch_exit_code`. `test_exit_codes.py` re-derives every row of
this table by driving the real CLI, so the doc fails its own gate if any code
ever drifts.

## Codes

| Code | Meaning | Terminal states that produce it | Stream + actionable message |
|------|---------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `0` | Success — no fatal violations. The invoice passed every implemented fatal rule (warnings/information do not affect the code). For `validate-batch`: every file passed, or the directory/glob matched no invoice files (`file_count: 0`). | `validate` on a conformant invoice; `receipt` whose verdict is `PASS`; `validate-batch` all-pass or empty match. | stdout: `PASS: <src> (all implemented fatal rules, profile=<p>)`. |
| `1` | Not-valid verdict — at least one implemented **fatal** rule failed. This is also where **unsupported / out-of-scope inputs land** (see note below): they are not a separate code, they trip a real fatal rule (e.g. a UBL `CreditNote` or a wrong root namespace fails `S-ROOT`). For `receipt`: a `FAIL` verdict, *including* not-well-formed input, which `receipt` folds into a FAIL receipt rather than exit 3. For `validate-batch`: ANY file has a fatal violation (fatal outranks a parse error). | `validate` on an invoice with a fatal violation or an out-of-scope document type; `receipt` FAIL; `validate-batch` any-fatal. | stdout: `FAIL: <src>` then `<RULE-ID>: <message>` and `offending element: <el>` (the first fatal rule id, e.g. `S-ROOT`). |
| `2` | Usage error — the tool was invoked wrong and did no validation. Bad or missing arguments, an unknown subcommand, an unknown `--profile` / `--lang` value, a `--profile`/`--lang` flag with no value, unexpected extra arguments, or a named input file that does not exist on disk. | `validate`/`validate-batch`/`receipt` with malformed argv or a missing file. | stderr: `error: <what>` and/or the `usage:` banner. |
| `3` | Not-well-formed input — the XML could not be parsed (truncated document, syntax error, or an input rejected by the hardened DTD/XXE parser). `validate` only. `receipt` folds this case into a FAIL receipt (exit `1`); `validate-batch` returns `3` only when some file *only* errored (not-well-formed / unsupported container) and no file had a fatal. | `validate` on malformed XML; `validate-batch` error-only, no-fatal. | stderr: `S-WF: input is not well-formed XML: <parser detail>`. |

## Stability guarantee

These codes are an append-only contract:

- An existing code's meaning is **never repurposed**. `0/1/2/3` mean what the
  table above says in every future release.
- New terminal outcomes may only be assigned a **new, higher, previously-unused
  code** — existing codes are never split or reassigned.
- Widening validation coverage (new rules, new profiles) does not add codes: a
  new fatal rule still surfaces as `1`, a new parse rejection still as `3`.

## Honest note on unsupported / out-of-scope inputs

There is deliberately **no dedicated "unsupported input" code**. When the tool
is handed something it does not fully support — a UBL `CreditNote`, a document
whose root element or namespace is not a UBL/CII `Invoice`, or a CII document
outside the implemented scope — it does **not** silently pass. Such inputs trip
a real structural fatal rule (typically `S-ROOT`, "Root element must be Invoice
in the UBL Invoice-2 namespace") and therefore surface as exit `1` with an
actionable `FAIL:` message naming the failing rule and the offending element.
The value to the caller is the same either way: a non-zero code plus a concrete,
greppable reason on stdout/stderr — never a false green. Folding these into the
existing `1` (rather than minting a new code) keeps the contract small and
honest; the message text, not a distinct number, tells you *why* it failed.
